# Introduction

The following principles apply across the solution and require more than a technical implementation:

* Information security policy and objectives shall be documented
* A security incident response plan shall exist
* Security issue disclosure policy shall be public
* Security shall be considered throughout software conception and development, and continue after release to support software
* Software development shall adhere to a published Secure Development Life cycle (SDL) based upon industry consensus
  * The SDL shall cover software development from idea through post-release activities
  * The SDL shall include secure design, secure implementation, and testing to assure security design and implementation
* Secure design activity will be based upon threat modeling to analyze for expected attacks to identify appropriate defenses to meet privacy expectations and other security objectives and requirements
